README for FrameD Lite PHP Framework

Just uncompress the framework and you should be ready to start programming. You will need to include the core file require_once for every action you create. Example, index.php is the action and the index.php will need to have the core items added.

Just include this:

/**
 * FrameD Core
 */
require_once('core/core.php');


For a full code example please review index.php.
